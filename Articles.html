                    <h5><u> Vegetarian Kids as Healthy as Omnivorous Kids</u></h5>
                    <p>“A study of nearly 9,000 children found those who eat a vegetarian diet had similar measures of
                        growth and nutrition
                        compared to children who eat meat. The study, published in Pediatrics and led by researchers at
                        St. Michael’s
                        Hospital of Unity Health Toronto, also found that children with a vegetarian diet had higher
                        odds of
                        underweight weight status, emphasizing the need for special care when planning the diets of
                        vegetarian kids.”

                            Sanctuary</a> in Colombia. She was brought to the
                        sanctuary at 2 days old because she was blind. Vani came from a breeder who raises llamas for
                        wool
                        and entertainment, petting zoos, for example. The owner was going to end her life, but the local
                        vet
                        knew about Juliana’s and offered to have them come pick her up. Vani received treatment and did
                        recover her eyesight. Now, she is often spotted on <a

                    <p>In the future, this page will be used to discuss different farm sanctuaries. From their
                        humble beginnings to the amazing things they do now. None of them have asked or paid me to write
                        about them.
                        I do it after admiring them for years from afar. But some people don’t even know what a farm
                        sanctuary is
                        and how they operate, so I will do a quick dive into that for the first article. A farm sanctuary is a place for typically farmed animals
