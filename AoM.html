        <p> <em>16 May 2022.</em> When veganism is brought up, oftentimes people who would never advise against actual unhealthy choices become
            nutrition experts. “What about protein?” “Are you getting enough B12?” “I had a friend who went vegan for 15
            minutes and ended up in the ER, divorced, and homeless.” “Our ancestors were meat eaters, it’s natural.”</p>

        <p>Now add kids to the equation and they become pediatricians as their child eats McNuggets for the third time
            this
            week. They’ll tell you it’s a choice the child should make when they’re older and if they do then it will be
            respected, but that’s also not very likely since they’re trying to talk me out of my choice to be vegan and
            I’m
            just a friend. One of the main arguments against it is malnutrition but more evidence piles up to show it is
            simply not the case. So enough with the anecdotes and on to the science.</p>

        <p>“A study of nearly 9,000 children found those who eat a vegetarian diet had similar measures of growth and
            nutrition compared to children who eat meat. The study, published in Pediatrics and led by researchers at
            St.
            Michael’s Hospital of Unity Health Toronto, also found that children with a vegetarian diet had higher odds
            of
            underweight weight status, emphasizing the need for special care when planning the diets of vegetarian
            kids.”
            -Science Daily</p>

        <p>The researchers monitored children ages 6 months to 8 years over a 3 year period and found that vegetarian
            children had nearly the same BMI (not my favorite measurement but they used it), heigh, iron, vitamin D, and
            cholesterol levels as their omnivorous counterparts. They did find that vegetarian children were more likely
            to
            be underweight based on BMI. However, there was no association with being overweight.</p>

        <p>They did say that one limitation was that they didn’t track exactly what the kids ate so they don’t know the
            exact quality of the diet. Researchers stated that these diets look different from person to person and the
            quality of the meal choices could make a real difference.</p>

        <p>More studies need to be done on vegan children for them to understand the nutritional value for them. I hope
            we
            see that soon, so we know if we’re doing what is absolutely best for our children and also so we can more
            easily
            shut down naysayers.</p>
