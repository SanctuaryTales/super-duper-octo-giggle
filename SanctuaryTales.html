        <p> <em>16 May 2022.</em> In the future, this page will be used to discuss different farm sanctuaries. From their
            humble beginnings to the amazing things they do now. None of them have asked or paid me to write about them.
            I do it after admiring them for years from afar. But some people don’t even know what a farm sanctuary is
            and how they operate, so I will do a quick dive into that for the first article. </p>

      <h4><strong>What is a farm sanctuary?</strong> </h4>
       <p>    
            A farm sanctuary is a place for typically farmed animals like cows, chickens, donkeys, horses, goats, etc.
            to be taken care of for the rest of their natural lives. Most of these animals came from places where they
            were being exploited and now get to live their lives in the closest thing they can get to paradise. Maybe in
            the most ideal situation, they would be free, but this isn’t a possibility for domesticated animals,
            therefore we have farm sanctuaries. </p>

       <h4><strong>What do they do?</strong></h4>
       <p>
            As stated before, they take care of the animals throughout their natural lives. They rehabilitate them if
            there are injuries, both physical and mental, and tend to their basic needs. Most sanctuaries often have
            educational programs for the general public too, where folks can come to meet the animals and learn about
            one of the cruelest industries in the world, the animal agriculture business. The animals are met on their
            terms. This means no riding horses or petting animals tied up to a fence. They come to people if they want
            attention and are otherwise left alone if they’re not in a good mood. Quite a few also offer B&Bs as well as
            vegan cooking courses. </p>

      <h4><strong>How do they get funding?</strong></h4>
        <p>
            Well, partially from public support. Each sanctuary does it differently, but a lot have an option to support
            a specific animal, make a general donation, buy from their stores, or support a fundraiser. I’m sure many
            receive donations from individuals and companies. As NPOs, they will also get tax breaks, but I’m unsure if
            they get government money. I don’t believe they do. When I write about specific sanctuaries, I will look
            over their financials as they are transparent about the money, and I will tell you all about it in future
            articles.

            I will go into more detail with each sanctuary, as while they do have similarities, each has its own rules
            and methods of doing things. I hope now you have a better understanding of sanctuaries.</p>
